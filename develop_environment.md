## Intro to dev_installer script

This shellscript manages the installation, update and remove of development software and toolset into a linux system (tested with Ubuntu 19.10).

Some of the applications/tools are installed using the package manager apt and are accessible for all users. Besides, if there an installation in the home user directory is prefered and used if possible. In this case, the application is only configured and available for the user.

The software is organized in the following **bundles** (by type of software):

- **base_config**: Creates the basic directory structure, adds a script that congigures the shell with the need environment variables to have all the applications availables and ready to use. Finally, a bunch of applications is installed.
- **development**: Installs the needed software to develep in different languages.
- **virtualization**: Virtualization tools and hypervisors.
- **docker_all**: Installs and configures Docker engine, some docker tools and kubernetes.
- **provisioning**: Some tools for managing configuration and provisioning are installed and configured.

Each *bundle* is composed of several applications or tools, that can be installed separately, providing its name. If the *bundle* name is provided, all the software included will be installed.
